title: Sketch Diary — 6/7
---

I briefly had a chat today with my friend Hans. He encouraged me to use physical techniques instead of always code. Thinking about today and how much I have been coding due to the CC assignment, doing something physical seemed like a good idea. This is why I am trying to use pen and aquarelle today. To get into the drawing mood, I am listening to [his music](https://wearepolypoly.com/) (which I can totally recommend by the way).

This could be a good method to also loosen up myself a little, hinting to Wesley's comment from yesterday.

#### Concept

I wanted to capture my experiences of the day in a sketch. Like a diary entry, I wanted to capture the most relevant aspects of today. 

#### Process

I started with a list of prompts that seemed to be worth capturing:

And then started right away drawing. I decided for a mixture between colorful aquarelles (as I enjoy using the technique) and clear iconographic line drawings. A mixture between two worlds.

After having done the sketch, I thought of creating a similar effect in a more randomized manner and scribbled the icons again, along with brush strokes, adding them to a P5 sketch (it seems I cannot live without code..).

#### Outcome

#### Reflection

It felt liberating to use physical tools again. Not being able to adjust the piece again feels uncomfortable for me, but exciting. Also I am not quite sure if I like the quick P5 sketch, but I also do not dislike it. I definitely want to, need to try out more projects that are less constrained by myself.
