This is my first entry, trying to figure out [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

As we should document our process in a blog, I thought that this might be a good opportunity to finally learn how to create a basic blog structure using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) within GitHub-pages. So please find the repository [here](https://github.com/olivierbrcknr/mfadt-ms1-blog) if you are interested in seeing how it is set up.

This blog will develop, depending on the projects it will contain. I intend to add features accordingly. 

Until then, have fun!
