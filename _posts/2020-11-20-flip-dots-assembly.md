title: Flip Dot Assembly

### Hardware

Unfortunately, the assembly of the flip dots is not documented on the website, but as I have not been the first person facing this issue, I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-VXi5K4Zl0) explaining some crucial elements. It is German though. I took the advice from the video and added placeholders in between to get the height right.

After having them assembled, I was able to run the [example script](https://github.com/ArduinoHannover/FlipDot_5x7/blob/master/examples/ShiftRegister/ShiftRegister.ino). To see how the dots are actually flipping, I wanted to record them in slow-motion. I have been mesmerized! The beauty of the flip dots first appeared completely in this video. Each dot flips mechanically (*duhh*) but they also flip slightly off-timed, bringing exactly this kind of unpredictable humanness into this digital communication realm that I aimed for. But see it yourself:
