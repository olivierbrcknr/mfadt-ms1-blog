title: Flip Dot Assembly

### Hardware

Unfortunately, the assembly of the flip dots is not documented on the website, but as I have not been the first person facing this issue, I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-VXi5K4Zl0) explaining some crucial elements. It is German though.

I took the advice from the video and added placeholders in between to get the height right.
