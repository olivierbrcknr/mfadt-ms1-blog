title: Arrival of Flip Dots
---

Today, the ordered flip dots arrived. Before assembling them I wanted to share the separate components as I think they are simply fascinating and beautiful.

The bright neon yellow on the dots is more mesmerizing than I had anticipated and it will definitely influence the further design of my project.

Now I need to assemble the elements to (1) be able to get the right measurements to continue developing the case and (2) to see how I can control them to see which parts I still might need to get.

In parallel, I have started to set up a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/olivierbrcknr/flipdot-communicator) in which I intend to create the communication and testing website and to upload building instructions for the hardware object.
